# Fix: Other Pages Not Loading on GitHub Pages

## The Problem

When you deployed to GitHub Pages, only the homepage (index.html) was in the root directory. The other pages were still in the `68d23d8f7f301.site123.me` folder, causing 404 errors when navigating.

## The Solution

All HTML pages need to be in the root directory for GitHub Pages to serve them correctly.

## Quick Fix - Run This Script

**Double-click:** `copy-all-pages.bat`

This will copy all pages to the correct location:
- ✓ about.html
- ✓ services.html  
- ✓ store.html
- ✓ store/ folder (with all product pages)

Then push the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added all website pages"
git push
```

## Your Site Structure

After running the script, your root directory will have:

```
site123/
├── index.html                    ← Home page
├── about.html                    ← About page
├── services.html                 ← Services page
├── store.html                    ← Store page
├── store/                        ← Product pages folder
│   ├── day-old-to-1-week-old-chicks.html
│   ├── 2-weeks.html
│   ├── 1-month-old-growers.html
│   ├── 2-month-old-growers.html
│   ├── 5-month-old-point-of-lay-hens-and-up.html

│   ├── promo-2-ready-to-lay-rush.html
│   ├── promo-3-grower-s-combo-deal.html
│   ├── rhode-island-reds-premium-dual-purpose-breeds.html
│   └── start-your-flock-promo-october-15-november-30-2025.html
├── 68d23d8f7f301.site123.me/     ← Original folder (can keep for backup)
├── cdn-cms-s-8-4.f-static.net/   ← CDN assets
├── files.cdn-files-a.com/        ← Files
├── fonts.gstatic.com/            ← Fonts
└── images.cdn-files-a.com/       ← Images
```

## URLs After Fix

Once deployed, your pages will be accessible at:

- **Home:** `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/`
- **About:** `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/about.html`
- **Services:** `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/services.html`
- **Store:** `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/store.html`
- **Products:** `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/store/[product-name].html`

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Run the script:** Double-click `copy-all-pages.bat`
2. **Verify files:** Check that about.html, services.html, store.html now exist in the root
3. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added all website pages for GitHub Pages"
   git push
   ```
4. **Wait:** GitHub Pages will redeploy (1-3 minutes)
5. **Test:** Visit your site and try clicking the navigation links

## Alternative: Manual Copy

If you prefer to copy files manually:

1. Copy these files from `68d23d8f7f301.site123.me` to the root:
   - about.html
   - services.html
   - store.html

2. Copy the entire `store` folder from `68d23d8f7f301.site123.me\store` to the root

3. Commit and push as shown above

## Why This Happens

SITE123 downloaded sites organize files in a folder structure, but GitHub Pages expects all pages in the root directory (or in properly structured subdirectories). The navigation links in your HTML point to `/about`, `/services`, etc., which need to be at the root level.

## Verification

After deploying, test all these links work:
- ✓ Home page loads
- ✓ About link in navigation works
- ✓ Services link works
- ✓ Store link works
- ✓ Product pages in store work

If you still see 404 errors, check the browser console (F12) for any path issues.
