                  WHY OTHER PAGES WON'T LOAD - SOLUTION
================================================================================

THE PROBLEM:
------------
Only index.html was copied to the root directory. Other pages are still in 
the "68d23d8f7f301.site123.me" folder, causing 404 errors.

When you click navigation links:
  ❌ /about       → 404 Not Found (looking in root, but file is in subfolder)
  ❌ /services    → 404 Not Found
  ❌ /store       → 404 Not Found


THE SOLUTION:
-------------
Copy ALL HTML pages to the root directory so GitHub Pages can serve them.
